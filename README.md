Analysis and visualization of droplet digital PCR, designed around a wild-type negative BRAF-V600 assay. Designed to be able to analyze duplex experiments with the following properties:

- most of the droplets are double-negative (empty droplets)
- most of the non-empty droplets are double-positive
- the secondary cluster of non-empty droplets is either HEX+ or FAM+

Most of the work is an improvement from the work [here](https://github.com/jennybc/haynes)
