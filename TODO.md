### Chip

- What LOD are you trying to claim? In theory, ddpcr can detect 1/20k or 0.005%. But that assumes that all 20k droplets are informative, let's assume that only 10% of drops are filled, that lieaves us with 2k droplets so minimum detection would be 0.05%. That's the theoretical absolute best of ddpcr if the assay and biology worked perfectly. I doubt you can claim this as the assay's LOD


### code

- separate functions into proper files

- add tests

- add documentation

### stats

- matias (stats prof) - better stats for outlier detection?

### shiny

- about tab
