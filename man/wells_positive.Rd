\title{Get wells containing mostly positive droplets in a PNPP experiment}
\usage{
wells_positive(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A ddPCR plate of type pnpp_experiment}
}
\value{
Vector of wells with mostly positive drops.
}
\description{
In a PNPP experiment, the two main non-empty clusters of drops are the negative
and positive clusters. The positive cluster appears in every well, while the
negative cluster is not necessarily in every well. \code{wells_positive}
returns a list of wells that have mostly positive drops.

\examples{
file <- system.file("sample_data", "small", "analyzed_pnpp.rds", package = "ddpcr")
plate <- load_plate(file)
plate \%>\% wells_positive
